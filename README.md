# S&Box Visual Novel Base (VNBase)

VNBase is a base for creating visual novels or dialogue systems for S&Box Games.

Scripts are written using a LISP-styled language called SandLang, an easy-to-learn DSL meant for making VNBase scripts.

Creating a simple dialogue system or a visual novel is easy, with the base including multiple example scripts. However, it is modular enough for anyone proficient to make custom functions and calculations if they so require, straight inside of SandLang, with little programming knowledge required.

## Showcase

Below is a video showcase of a simple example project made with VNBase.
