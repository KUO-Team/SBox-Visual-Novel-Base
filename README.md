# S&Box Visual Novel Base (VNBase)

VNBase is a base for creating visual novels or dialogue systems for S&Box Games.

It uses a base-networkable Script Player object for each pawn to load and play dialogue scripts from, where scripts are written using a LISP-styled language called SandLang.

Creating a simple dialogue system or a visual novel is easy. The base includes multiple example scripts. However, it is modular enough for anyone proficient to make custom functions and calculations if they so require.
