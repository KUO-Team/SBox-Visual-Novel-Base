# S&Box Visual Novel Base (VNBase)

VNBase is a base for creating visual novels or dialogue systems for S&Box Games.

It uses a base-networkable Script Player object for each pawn to load and play dialogue scripts from, where scripts are written using a LISP-styled language called SandLang.

Creating a simple dialogue system or a visual novel is easy. The base includes multiple example scripts. However, it is modular enough for anyone proficient to make custom functions and calculations if they so require.

# Contributing

Anyone is free to contribute to the base by creating a pull request. Contributions are always welcome if you have any improvements, bug fixes or just wish to add some cool new features to the base. Any and all help is appreciated.
